## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS
- CSS Animations
- CSS Media Queries


### What I learned

I learnt how to create a dropdown menu for large screens. I can create for smaller screens but it was a challenge for it to work
in the same manner for larger screens. I also better understood the ```classList.toggle()``` javascript method which as its name implies toggles a class name for the specified element. 

### Continued development

I am going to revisit this website to better optimize it for better responsiveness across all screen sizes

### Useful resources

- [Clickable Dropdowns](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_dropdown.asp) - This helped me to create a dropdown menu for large screens. I highly recommend this for anyone who like me struggles/struggled with dropdown menus.
